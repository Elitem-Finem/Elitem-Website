                        <p>Elitem has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. 
                            Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) 
                            through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry 
                            Data Security Standards) certification. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third 
                            Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Regardless of the measures and efforts taken by Elitem, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information, your 
                            Users-of-Users’ Personal Information or any other information you upload, publish or otherwise share with Elitem or anyone else. We encourage you to set strong 
                            passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive Personal Information of which you believe its disclosure 
                            could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be “Public” instead of “Private”, 
                            or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to 
                            share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.
                        </p>
